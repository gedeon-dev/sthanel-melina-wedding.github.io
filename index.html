                    <p>It all began in May 2024, though neither of us knew it yet.<br>
                        Sthanel, a young French man, was seeking God’s will for his life. In prayer, he received one word: “army.” That led him to begin the recruitment process for the French military. Around the same time, he discovered a Bible school in Kilgoris, Kenya, through the website of his church, SOS Lyon, where he had been attending for a year. His pastor offered to speak with him about it after service.<br><br>
                        That same Sunday, Milana, a missionary from the U.S., came to preach at SOS Lyon. She had just come through a difficult season in Kenya and was sent to Europe to speak in the SOS churches across Switzerland and France.

                <h2 class="title reveal-1"><span>Our Story</span>The first exchanges</h2>
                <p class="justify-text reveal-2">Though they were in the same church that day, they didn’t meet.
                    Later, when Milana saw the new Bible school students, one face stood out: Sthanel’s. Something about him caught her attention.
                    When he arrived in Kenya, Sthanel saw Milana holding a child and thought she was a mom. At that exact moment, Milana thought, <strong>“I should give this child back before he thinks they’re mine.”</strong>
                    Their first real interaction came soon after.
                    Milana asked:
                    <strong>– What made you come to Kenya?</strong>
                    Sthanel answered simply:
                    <strong>– You’re the reason I’m here.</strong>
                    Milana was stunned, but held it in… and walked away smiling.
                    Over the following months, they built a friendship, served Jesus together, and something beautiful began to grow.</p>

                    <p>Then, on December 25, 2024, in the picturesque village of Saint-Antonin-Noble-Val in France, overlooking a cliff, Sthanel proposed. Milana said yes. Now they’re back in Kenya — Milana continuing her mission, and Sthanel finished MBS and LA — as they prepare for the next chapter… A wedding by the beach in Mombasa.<br><br>Will you be part of their story?</p>
